## PeopleDAO, we the people, for the people.

PeopleDAO is the legacy of [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/). ConstitutionDAO [failed](https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461498841820192771) in the bidding for the copy of U.S. constitution.

But [$people](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7a58c0be72be218b41c608b7fe7c5bb630736c71) coin can be refund by 1million $people to 1 ether anytime.

### [CRYPTO MANIFESTO](https://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/classes/6.805/articles/crypto/cypherpunks/may-crypto-manifesto.html)
$PEOPLE would be the first "nation" build on the internet regardless the location you are.
