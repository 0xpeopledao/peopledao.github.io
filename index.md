## PeopleDAO, we the people, for the people.

PeopleDAO is the legacy of [ConstitutionDAO](https://www.constitutiondao.com/). ConstitutionDAO [failed](https://twitter.com/ConstitutionDAO/status/1461498841820192771) in the bidding for the copy of U.S. constitution.

But [$people](https://etherscan.io/token/0x7a58c0be72be218b41c608b7fe7c5bb630736c71) coin can be [refunded](https://juicebox.money/#/p/constitutiondao) with 1million $people = 1 ether anytime.
